# Index Api

## What is this about?
The Index API serves the client as an endpoint to send the catalogue, with the data of all the products and associated behaviour of these.

**Constants:**

* INDEX_SERVICE_URL = <https://preindex.empathybroker.com> (STAGING environment) 
* INDEX_SERVICE_URL = <https://index.empathybroker.com> (LIVE environment)

## Step by step guide
### Step 1: Obtaing the INDEX_TOKEN and FEED_IDs
First of all, you must have an **INDEX_TOKEN** and one or more **FEED_ID**s, if you donÂ´t have anything  of this  you must  get them. **INDEX_TOKEN** and a list of one or more **FEED_ID**s can be obtained from your Account Manager, consulting to Appointed Lead Developer or alternatively contact [support@empathybroker.com](mailto:support@empathybroker.com).

### Step 2: Post a new feed to the service
Now, with the previous information, you can post a new feed to the service. You can choose one of this  ways:

* [POST using Postman](/api-reference/index-api/post-new-feed/post-postman/)
* [Post using CURL instructions ](/api-reference/index-api/post-new-feed/post-curl/)
* [Post using Empathy dashboard instructions](/api-reference/index-api/post-new-feed/post-empathy/)

After posting the file the system will return something like:

```
{
  "id":"JOB_ID",
  "clientId":"CLIENT_NAME",
  "feedId":"FEED_ID",
  "fileId":"GENERATED_FILE_NAME",
  "state":"QUEUED",
  "date":"CURRENT_DATE"
}
```

Being the values:

* **JOB_ID** : ID of the job generated by the service
* **CLIENT_NAME** : Your assigned client name
* **FEED_ID** : Feed that you are using for sending the file
